=head1 Name

pgxn_site_server - The PGXN API server

=head1 Usage

  pgxn_api_server --api-url http://api.pgxn.org/ \
                  --errors-to   alerts@example.com \
                  --errors-from oops@example.com \
                  --feedback-to feedback@example.com \

=head1 Description

This is the PGXN API PSGI server. It automatically figures out the environment
it is run in, and runs your application in that environment. C<FastCGI>,
C<CGI>, C<AnyEvent> and others can all be detected. See L<Plack::Loader> for
the authoritative list.

=head1 Options

     --api-url          URL    URL for the PGXN API server.
     --private-api-url  URL    URL to a private API server.
     --errors-to        EMAIL  Email to which error messages should be sent.
     --errors-from      EMAIL  Email to use on the From line of error messages.
     --feedback-to      EMAIL  Email to which users can submit feedback.

  -o --host                    Bind TCP daemon to the specified interface.
  -p --port                    Listen on the specified TCP port.
  -s --server                  Plack server to use.
  -S --socket                  UNIX domain socket path to listen on.
  -l --listen                  Address to listen on.
  -D --daemonize               Make the process go to the background.
  -I                   PATH    Specify a Perl include library path.
  -E --env             ENV     Run with the specified environment.
  -r --reload                  Reload when a development file changes.
  -R --Reload          PATH    Reload when a file in the specified path changes.
  -L --loader          LOADER  Run with specified loading class.
     --access-log      PATH    Write access log to the specified file.
  -h --help                    Print a usage statement and exit.
  -m --man                     Print the complete documentation and exit.
  -v --version                 Print the version number and exit.

=head1 Option Details

=over

=item C<--api-url>

URL for a L<PGXN::API>-powered API server. Most of the site content comes from
the API and many links go back to it.

=item C<--private-api-url>

URL for a private L<PGXN::API>-powered API server. Useful if the API server is
on the same box or a shared file system, as you can then use a F<file:> URL to
access the content directly from the file system rather than over HTTP.

=item C<--errors-to>

Specify an email address to which to send error information. Whenever the
server encounters a 500 error, it will send detailed information, including a
stack trace, to this address.

=item C<--errors-from>

The email address from which error messages should appear to be sent.

=item C<--feedback-to>

Specify an email address to be published in the app as a link. Users will be
able to click the link to send feedback about the site.

=item C<--reverse-proxy>

Specify this option if the server is running behind a reverse proxy server.
This activate the C<Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy> middleware, which fixes
proxied requests so that end-user client data is properly available to the app
(and URLs in the app will be correct).

=item C<-o>, C<--host>

The interface a TCP based server daemon binds to. Defaults to C<undef>, which
lets most server back ends bind the any (C<*>) interface. This option does
nothing if the server does not support TCP socket.

=item C<-p>, C<--port>

The port number a TCP based server daemon listens on. Defaults to 5000. This
option does nothing if the server does not support TCP socket.

=item C<-s>, C<--server>

Select a specific implementation to run on using the C<PLACK_SERVER>
environment variable or use the C<-s> or C<--server> flag which will be
preferred over the environment variable.

=item C<-S>, C<--socket>

UNIX domain socket path to listen on. Defaults to C<undef>. This option does
nothing if the server doesn't support UNIX sockets.

=item C<-l>, C<--listen>

Addresses on which to listen. It could be C<HOST:PORT>, C<:PORT> or C<PATH>
(without colons). It could be multiple but it depends on the server
implementations whether multiple interfaces are supported.

=item C<-D>, C<--daemonize>

Makes the process go background. It's up to the back end server/handler
implementation whether this option is respected or not.

=item C<-I>

Specify perl library include path, like C<perl>'s -I option.

=item C<-E>, C<--env>

Specify the environment option (default is C<development>). You can set this
value by setting C<PLACK_ENV> environment variable as well, and specifying the
value with the command line options writes back to C<PLACK_ENV> as well, so
the API server can tell which environment setting the application is running
on.

  # These two are the same
  pgxn_site_server -E deployment
  env PLACK_ENV=deployment pgxn_site_server

The value can be anything but commonly used ones are C<development>,
C<deployment> and C<test>.

If it's set to C<development>, following middleware components are enabled by
default: C<AccessLog>, C<StackTrace> and C<Lint>.

=item C<-r>, C<--reload>

Watch for updates in your development directory and restart the server
whenever a file is updated. This option by default watches the C<lib>
directory. Use C<-R> if you want to watch other directories.

=item C<-R>, C<--Reload>

C<-R> option allows you to specify the path to watch file updates separated by
comma (C<,>).

  pgxn_site_server -R /path/to/project/lib,/path/to/project/templates

=item C<-L>, C<--loader>

Specify the server loading subclass that implements how to run the server.
Available options are I<Plack::Loader> (default), C<Restarter> (automatically
set when C<-r> or C<-R> is used), I<Delayed> and I<Shotgun>.

See L<Plack::Loader::Delayed> and L<Plack::Loader::Shotgun> when to
use those loader types.

=item C<--access-log>

Specify the path to a file where the access log should be written. By default,
in the development environment access logs will go to C<STDERR>.

=item C<-h> C<--help>

Outputs usage information and exits.

=item C<-m> C<--man>

Outputs this full documentation and exits.

=item C<-v> C<--version>

Outputs the version and exits.

=back

Other options that starts with C<--> are passed through to the back end
server. See the appropriate L<Plack::Handler> back end documentation to see
which options are available.
