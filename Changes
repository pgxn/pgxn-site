Revision history for Perl extension PGXN::Site

0.2.0
      - Fixed some URIs so that they no longer reveal private URLs from behind
        a proxy server. That is, all local URLs should be relative to the
        document root, and not contain the scheme or host name.
      - Added Gravatar to user page.
      - Added `reverse_proxy` option, so that the default gravatar URL will
        work properly for proxied servers.

0.1.0   2011-04-03T20:24:35
      - Initial version.
