Revision history for Perl extension PGXN::Site

0.4.1
      - An invalid search query, such as "*", "", or "?", now returns a 400
        response.
      - Removed `robots.txt` route. This baby's going live tomorrow!
      - Changed tags on home page to all be the same size and color. Just for
        now, while there are a limited number of tags all with only one
        associated distribution. It looks awful when they're all huge and red.

0.4.0   2011-04-11T23:41:16
      - Updated tag cloud and recent releases code to rely on the new files
        generated by PGXN::Manager 0.11.0.
      - Added the version to the footer.
      - Added summary stats to the About page.

0.3.0  2011-04-07T18:19:55
      - Renamed "backers" to "donors".

0.2.0   2011-04-07T18:02:50
      - Fixed some URIs so that they no longer reveal private URLs from behind
        a proxy server. That is, all local URLs should be relative to the
        document root, and not contain the scheme or host name.
      - Added Gravatar to user page.
      - Added `reverse_proxy` option, so that the default gravatar URL will
        work properly for proxied servers.
      - Added tag cloud to the home page.
      - Added page with list of recent releases.

0.1.0   2011-04-03T20:24:35
