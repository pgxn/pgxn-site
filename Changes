Revision history for Perl extension PGXN::Site

0.6.1

0.6.0   2011-04-20T05:35:52
      - Requests should now all be returned with an appropriate
        `Content-Length` header.
      - A search request with no query parameter now redirects back to the
        home page or, if it's on the same site, the referring page.
      - Load users starting with a letter from the new "userlist" API.
      - Updated for PGXN::API v0.12.0, notably changed method names for
        fetching HTML documentation files in WWW::PGXN and doc path keys.

0.5.1   2011-04-13T18:12:57
      - Added the PGXN::Site version string as a query parameter to the CSS
        URLs. This should force them to be reloaded after the release of any
        new version by browsers that would otherwise cache them.
      - Fixed the display of the table of contents sidebar on the
        documentation page on Firefox. Per gripe from depesz.
      - Moved the HTML rendering of the spec to /spec/.

0.5.0   2011-04-13T02:25:37
      - An invalid search query, such as "*", "", or "?", now returns a 400
        response.
      - Removed `robots.txt` route. This baby's going live tomorrow!
      - Changed tags on home page to all be the same size and color. Just for
        now, while there are a limited number of tags all with only one
        associated distribution. It looks awful when they're all huge and red.
      - Using the user's profile page for the Gravatar link URL if the user
        has specified no URL.
      - Added documentation for all controller action methods.
      - Added Meta Spec pages (HTML and text).

0.4.0   2011-04-11T23:41:16
      - Updated tag cloud and recent releases code to rely on the new files
        generated by PGXN::Manager 0.11.0.
      - Added the version to the footer.
      - Added summary stats to the About page.

0.3.0  2011-04-07T18:19:55
      - Renamed "backers" to "donors".

0.2.0   2011-04-07T18:02:50
      - Fixed some URIs so that they no longer reveal private URLs from behind
        a proxy server. That is, all local URLs should be relative to the
        document root, and not contain the scheme or host name.
      - Added Gravatar to user page.
      - Added `reverse_proxy` option, so that the default gravatar URL will
        work properly for proxied servers.
      - Added tag cloud to the home page.
      - Added page with list of recent releases.

0.1.0   2011-04-03T20:24:35
      - Initial version.
