<dl>
<dt><span id="extension"></span></dt>
<dt>WTF is an “extension”?</dt>
<dd>An extension is a piece of software that adds functionality to PostgreSQL
itself. Examples are data types (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/citext.html">citext</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hstore.html">hstore</a>), utilities (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/dblink.html">dblink</a>,
<a href="https://pgxn.org/extension/pgtap">pgTAP</a>), and procedural languages (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plperl.html">PL/Perl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/postgres-plr/plr">PL/R</a>), among others. See
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend.html">Extending SQL</a> for details.</dd>

<dt><span id="allowed"></span></dt>
<dt>What’s allowed to be released on PGXN?</dt>
<dd>Open-source PostgreSQL extension release packages. The <a href="https://manager.pgxn.org/howto">How To</a> documents
the contents of such packages. Following the <a href="https://www.cpan.org/misc/ZCAN.html">CPAN example</a>, “no commercial
software of any kind, not even share/guilt/donateware, will be allowed…any
other policy would be open to nitpicking, or maybe even legal challenges.”</dd>

<dt><span id="notallowed"></span></dt>
<dt>What’s not allowed to be released on PGXN?</dt>
<dd>Non-package files (that is, files that are not tarballs, bzip-balls, or zip
archives), closed-source distributions, and distributions with no license.</dd>

<dt><span id="whocanrelease"></span></dt>
<dt>Who can release on PGXN?</dt>
<dd>Any registered user.</dd>

<dt><span id="whocanregister"></span></dt>
<dt>Who can register for PGXN?</dt>
<dd>Anyone who applies. Such registrations will be approved by volunteers, but
we’re usually pretty quick to respond to requests.</dd>

<dt><span id="howtoapply"></span></dt>
<dt>So how do I apply?</dt>
<dd>Head on over to <a href="https://manager.pgxn.org/">PGXN Manager</a> and hit the “<a href="https://manager.pgxn.org/account/register">Request Account</a>” link. Once
you’ve signed up, unless you’re obviously a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(slang)">troll</a>, your account will be
quickly approved.</dd>

<dt><span id="releaseapproval"></span></dt>
<dt>Okay, I have an account and want to release an extension. Is there a release</dt>
<dt>approval process?</dt>
<dd>Short answer: No, because PGXN needs to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>. Longer answer: No. Again
following the <a href="https://www.cpan.org/misc/ZCAN.html">CPAN example</a>, PGXN “is and will stay an open and free forum,
where the authors decide what they upload. Any further selection belongs to
different fora.” This is because “the first goal of PGXN is to make it easy
to submit code and redistribute it. Ease of use and quality control are not
the central problems ~[it~] tries to solve.” (Original quotation lost to
time and internet entropy.) Frankly, moderation of releases is a significant
reason that other communities have failed to duplicate the success of CPAN.</dd>

<dt><span id="howto"></span></dt>
<dt>Great, so how do I create an extension distribution and release it?</dt>
<dd>Basically, you upload an archive file with a <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/">META.json</a> file describing the
distribution. Have a look at the <a href="https://manager.pgxn.org/howto">How To</a> for all the details.</dd>

<dt><span id="github"></span></dt>
<dt>I read that, but it seems like an awful lot of work for something that should be</dt>
<dt>automated. Is there any way I can automatically have my extension appear on PGXN</dt>
<dt>when I make a release on GitHub?</dt>
<dd><p>Yes! You can use the <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools">pgxn-tools</a> Docker image as part of your release
workflows. It supports both testing an extension with multiple versions of
Postgres, as well as releasing extensions on GitHub and PGXN. For details,
check out these blog posts:</p>

<dt><span id="maillist"></dt>
<dt>Is there some place I can go to ask questions and get help from like-minded PGXN</dt>
<dt>contributors?</dt>
<dd>Yes, there is a <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/pgxn-users">Google Group</a> for this very purpose. Join us!</dd>

<dt><span id="goodbadugly"></span></dt>
<dt>How does PGXN make it easy to distinguish the garbage from the viable</dt>
<dt>extensions?</dt>
<dd>The first step is the PGXN search engine, accessible via the <a href="https://pgxn.org/">home page</a>,
which will allow you to find extensions relevant to you and to read their
documentation. This will “often ~[be~] enough to distinguish the good stuff
from the crap,” as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/603c8f071001061718t40e42609y59a26165bb72ff01@mail.gmail.com">Robert Haas says</a>. As more extensions are released on
PGXN with competing features and functionality, the addition of ratings
features and dedicated testing will also make it easier to evaluate
competing options.</dd>

<h2 id="pgxnclient">PGXN Client</h2>

<dl>
<dt><span id="commandlineclient"></span></dt>
<dt>Is there a command-line client for installing extensions from PGXN?</dt>
<dd><p>There is! Install it with this command:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">sudo easy_install pgxnclient
</code></pre>

<p>If you use <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">brew install pgxnclient
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can install PGXN extensions with a simple command:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">pgxn install pair
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>pgxn help</code> to get a list of supported commands; or check out the
introductory <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/5026314153/writing-a-client-for-pgxn">blog</a> <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/5118152273/new-release-for-the-pgxn-client">posts</a>, the <a href="https://pgxn.github.io/pgxnclient/">complete documentation</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxnclient">source
code</a>.</p></dd>

<dt><span id="howclientworks"></span></dt>
<dt>How does the command-line client work?</dt>
<dd>It uses JSON-based API available on every PGXN mirror to find, download,
build, and install extensions. It relies on <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html">PGXS</a> to do the heavy lifting
to build extensions.</dd>

<dt><span id="clientwindows"></span></dt>
<dt>What about Windows?</dt>
<dd>The PGXN client follows the lead of the PostgreSQL core on installing
extensions. If support for installing extensions on Windows improves such
that a compiler is no longer required, the PGXN client will be modified as
appropriate to take advantage of it. This applies not specifically to
Windows, but to the ability of the core installer (or any future
community-supported installer) to work on <em>any</em> platform.</dd>

<dt><span id="clientsecurity"></span></dt>
<dt>What kind of security does PGXN have?</dt>
<dd>Each release package has an accompanying SHA1 hash that the PGXN client
verifies before installing an extension.</dd>

<h2 id="contributingtopgxn">Contributing to PGXN</h2>

<dl>
<dt><span id="license"></span></dt>
<dt>Under what license is PGXN’s source code distributed?</dt>
<dd><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/">The PostgreSQL License</a>. Note that the actual extensions themselves may be
under any open source license, determined by their authors.</dd>

<dt><span id="contribute"></span></dt>
<dt>Can other people contribute to PGXN?</dt>
<dd>Definitely! Contributions and help with refining the specification are very
welcome. Major code contributions may be funded out of the PGXN fund based
on circumstances. Any contributions must be submitted under The PostgreSQL
License.</dd>

<dt><span id="mirroring"></span></dt>
<dt>What about mirroring? Can I create a PGXN mirror?</dt>
<dd>Absolutely! See <a href="https://pgxn.org/mirroring/">mirroring</a> for the details.</dd>

<dt><span id="owners"></span></dt>
<dt>Who owns and runs PGXN?</dt>
<dd>Currently, PGXN is hosted on a box owned by <a href="https://www.depesz.com">depesz</a>. Eventually it may run
on community servers, as the PostgreSQL.org Web Team determines. Or it may
end up on one or more servers to be contributed to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/policies/funds-group/">PostgreSQL Funds
Group</a>. In any case, the PGXN master index and server will always be
contributed to the PostgreSQL community.</dd>

<dt><span id="source"></span></dt>
<dt>Where is the PGXN source code hosted?</dt>
<dd><a href="https://github.com/pgxn/">On GitHub</a>. Please feel free to fork and send pull requests!</dd>

<dt><span id="language"></span></dt>
<dt>What language is PGXN written in?</dt>
<dd>Mostly Perl. The database used by <a href="https://manager.pgxn.org/">PGXN Manager</a> is written in SQL,
PL/pgSQL, and PL/Perl — and even uses <a href="https://pgxn.org/extension/semver">semver</a>, a <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic version</a> data
type written in C and distributed right here on PGXN!</dd>

<dt><span id="api"></span></dt>
<dt>Is there an API?</dt>
<dd>Yes! The <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxn-api/wiki/">PGXN API</a> provides centralized index and API of distribution
metadata, as well as the search APIs used here.</dd>

<dt><span id="logos"></span></dt>
<dt>Is the PGXN logo available for use?</dt>
<dd>Yes, see <a href="https://pgxn.org/art/">identity</a> for the license details and downloadable artwork.</dd>
