Frequently Asked Questions

Releasing on PGXN
-----------------

<span id="extension"></span>
WTF is an “extension”?

:   An extension is a piece of software that adds functionality to PostgreSQL
    itself. Examples are data types ([citext], [hstore]), utilities ([dblink],
    [pgTAP]), and procedural languages ([PL/Perl], [PL/R]), among others. See
    [Extending SQL] for details.

<span id="allowed"></span>
What’s allowed to be released on PGXN?

:   Open-source PostgreSQL extension release packages. The [How To] documents
    the contents of such packages. Following the [CPAN example], “no commercial
    software of any kind, not even share/guilt/donateware, will be allowed…any
    other policy would be open to nitpicking, or maybe even legal challenges.”

<span id="notallowed"></span>
What’s not allowed to be released on PGXN?

:   Non-package files (that is, files that are not tarballs, bzip-balls, or zip
    archives), closed-source distributions, and distributions with no license.
                   
<span id="whocanrelease"></span>
Who can release on PGXN?

:   Any registered user.

<span id="whocanregister"></span>
Who can register for PGXN?

:   Anyone who applies. Such registrations will be approved by volunteers, but
    we’re usually pretty quick to respond to requests.
                   
<span id="howtoapply"></span>
So how do I apply?

:   Head on over to [PGXN Manager] and hit the“[Request Account]” link. Once
    you’ve signed up, unless you’re obviously a [troll], your account will be
    quickly approved.
                   
<span id="releaseapproval"></span>
Okay, I have an account and want to release an extension. Is there a release approval process?

:   Short answer: No, because PGXN needs to [KISS]. Longer answer: No. Again
    following the [CPAN example], PGXN “ is and will stay an open and free
    forum, where the authors decide what they upload. Any further selection
    belongs to different fora.” This is because “the first goal of PGXN is to
    make it easy to submit code and redistribute it. Ease of use and quality
    control are not the central problems ~[it~] tries to solve.” (Original
    quotation lost to time and internet entropy.) Frankly, moderation of
    releases is a significant reason that other communities have failed to
    duplicate the success of CPAN.
                   
<span id="howto"></span>
Great, so how do I create an extension distribution and release it?

:   Basically, you upload an archive file with a [META.json] file describing the
    distribution. Have a look at the [How To] for all the details.

<span id="maillist">
Is there some place I can go to ask questions and get help from like-minded PGXN contributors?

:   Yes, there is a [Google Group] for this very purpose. Join us!

<span id="goodbadugly"></span>
How does PGXN make it easy to distinguish the garbage from the viable extensions?

:   The first step is the PGXN search engine, accessible via the [home page],
    which will allow you to find extensions relevant to you and to read their
    documentation. This will “often ~[be~] enough to distinguish the good stuff
    from the crap,” as [Robert Haas says]. As more extensions are released on
    PGXN with competing features and functionality, the addition of ratings
    features and dedicated testing will also make it easier to evaluate
    competing options.

PGXN Client
-----------

<span id="commandlineclient"></span>
Is there a command-line client for installing extensions from PGXN?

:   There is! Install it with this command:
:   <pre>sudo easy_install pgxnclient</pre>
:   Then you can install PGXN extensions with a simple command:
:   <pre>pgxn install pair</pre>
:   Run `pgxn help` to get a list of supported commands; or check out the
    introductory [blog] [posts], the [complete documentation] or the [source
    code].
                   
<span id="howclientworks"></span>
How will the command-line client work?

:   It will use the JSON-based API available on every PGXN mirror to find,
    download, build, and install extensions. It will rely on [PGXS] to do the
    heavy lifting.
                   
<span id="clientwindows"></span>
What about Windows?

:   The PGXN client will always follow the lead of the PostgreSQL core on
    installing extensions. If support for installing extensions on Windows
    improves such that a compiler is no longer required, the PGXN client will be
    modified as appropriate to take advantage of it. This applies not
    specifically to Windows, but to the ability of the core installer (or any
    future community-supported installer) to work on *any* platform.
                   
<span id="clientsecurity"></span>
What kind of security does PGXN have?

:   Each release package has an accompanying SHA1 hash that the PGXN client will
    verify before installing an extension.

Contributing to PGXN
--------------------

<span id="license"></span>
Under what license is PGXN’s source code distributed?

:   [The PostgreSQL License]. Note that the actual extensions themselves may be
    under any open source license, according to their authors.

<span id="contribute"></span>
Can other people contribute to PGXN?

:   Definitely! Contributions and help with refining the specification are very
    welcome. Major code contributions may be funded out of the PGXN fund based
    on circumstances. Any contributions must be submitted under The PostgreSQL
    License.
                   
<span id="owners"></span>
Who owns and runs PGXN?

:   Currently, PGXN is hosted on a box owned by [depesz]. Hopefully the
    PostgreSQL.org Web Team eventually run PGXN on community servers. If they
    choose not to administrate it, PGXN will be run on one or more servers to be
    contributed to the [PostgreSQL Funds Group]. In any case, the PGXN master
    index and server will be owned by a PostgreSQL-related nonprofit
    organization.
                   
<span id="source"></span>
Where is the PGXN source code hosted?

:   [On GitHub]. Please feel free to fork and send pull requests!
                   
<span id="language"></span>
What language is PGXN written in?

:   Mostly Perl. The database used by [PGXN Manager] is written in SQL,
    PL/pgSQL, and PL/Perl (and even uses [semver], a [semantic version] data
    type written in C and distributed right here on PGXN!)
                   
<span id="api"></span>
Is there an API?

:   Yes! The [PGXN API] provides centralized index and API of distribution
    metadata.
