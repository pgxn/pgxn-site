PGXN::Site
==========

[PGXN](https://www.pgxn.org/), the PostgreSQL Extension network, is a central
distribution system for open-source PostgreSQL extension libraries. It consists
of four basic parts:

*   [PGXN Manager]: An upload and distribution infrastructure for extension
    developers.

*   [PGXN API]: A centralized index and API of distribution metadata.

*   [PGXN Search]: This site, for searching extensions and perusing their
    documentation.

*   [PGXN Client]: A command-line client for downloading, testing, and
    installing extensions.

Who’s Made This?
----------------

[I did]. I’m David Wheeler, inveterate Perl and PostgreSQL hacker. I love the
[extensibility] of PostgreSQL and have long been a fan of [CPAN], the Perl
community’s distributed collection of Perl software and documentation. But
PostgreSQL’s extensibility is not well-known, and it’s difficult to find the
extensions that do exist. I’d like to solve that problem. Care to help?
