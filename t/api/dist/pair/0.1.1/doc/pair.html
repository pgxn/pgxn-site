Synopsis
--------

    % SELECT pair('foo', 'bar');
        pair    
    ------------
     (foo,bar)

     % SELECT 'foo' ~&gt; 'bar';
         pair    
     ------------
      (foo,bar)
    
Description
-----------

This library contains a single PostgreSQL extension, a key/value pair data
type called `pair`, along with a convenience function for constructing
key/value pairs. It's just a simple thing, really: a two-value composite type
that can store any type of value in its slots, which are named "k" and "v".

So what's it good for? Well, the main idea is if you have a custom function to
which you'd like to be able to pass any number of key/value pairs. You could
use [hstore](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/hstore.html) of
course, but maybe it's overkill, or you need to guarantee the order in which
the pairs are passed. If so, then this extension is for you.

The `pair` data type was created as an inspiration, as documented in
[this blog post](http://justatheory.com/computers/databases/postgresql/key-value-pairs.html).
Give it a read if you're interested in the context of its creation.

Usage
-----
There are two ways to construct key/value pairs: Via the `pair()` function:

    % SELECT pair('foo', 'bar');
        pair    
    ------------
     (foo,bar)

Or by using the `~&gt;` operator:

    % SELECT 'foo' ~&gt; 'bar';
        pair    
    ------------
     (foo,bar)

To access the values, just use the `k` and `v` column names:

    SELECT ('foo' ~&gt; 'bar').k;
      k  
    -----
     foo
    (1 row)

    SELECT ('foo' ~&gt; 'bar').v;
      v  
    -----
     bar

KInd of ugly, huh? Well pairs aren't very useful on their own. Where they
really come into their own is when used as the last parameter to a variadic
function.

For example, say you wanted a function to store any number of key/value pairs
in a table. Here's what it might look like:

    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION store(
        params variadic pair[]
    ) RETURNS VOID LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
    DECLARE
        param pair;
    BEGIN
        FOR param IN SELECT * FROM unnest(params) LOOP
            UPDATE kvstore
               SET value = param.v,
             WHERE key = param.k;
            CONTINUE WHEN FOUND;
            INSERT INTO kvstore (key, value) VALUES (param.k, param.v);
        END LOOP;
    END;
    $$;

And to use it, pass in any number of pairs you like:

    SELECT store( 'foo' ~&gt; 'bar', 'baz' ~&gt; 1 );
