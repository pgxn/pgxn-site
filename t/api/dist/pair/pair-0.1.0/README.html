<p>This library contains a single PostgreSQL extension, a key/value pair data
type called <code>pair</code>, along with a convenience function for constructing
key/value pairs. It's just a simple thing, really: a two-value composite type
that can store any type of value in its slots, which are named "k" and "v".</p>

<p>The <code>pair</code> data type was created as an inspiration, as documented in
<a href="http://justatheory.com/computers/databases/postgresql/key-value-pairs.html">this blog post</a>.
Give it a read if you're interested in the context of its creation.</p>

<p>To build it, just do this:</p>

<pre><code>make
make installcheck
make install
</code></pre>

<p>If you encounter an error such as:</p>

<pre><code>"Makefile", line 8: Need an operator
</code></pre>

<p>You need to use GNU make, which may well be installed on your system as
<code>gmake</code>:</p>

<pre><code>gmake
gmake install
gmake installcheck
</code></pre>

<p>If you encounter an error such as:</p>

<pre><code>make: pg_config: Command not found
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure that you have <code>pg_config</code> installed and in your path. If you used a
package management system such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, be sure that the
<code>-devel</code> package is also installed. If necessary tell the build process where
to find it:</p>

<pre><code>env PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config make &amp;&amp; make installcheck &amp;&amp; make install
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, if all that fails (and if you're on PostgreSQL 8.1 or lower, it
likely will), copy the entire distribution directory to the <code>contrib/</code>
subdirectory of the PostgreSQL source tree and try it there without
<code>pg_config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>env NO_PGXS=1 make &amp;&amp; make installcheck &amp;&amp; make install
</code></pre>

<p>If you encounter an error such as:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR:  must be owner of database regression
</code></pre>

<p>You need to run the test suite using a super user, such as the default
"postgres" super user:</p>

<pre><code>make installcheck PGUSER=postgres
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>pair</code> date type has no dependencies other than PostgreSQL.</p>
