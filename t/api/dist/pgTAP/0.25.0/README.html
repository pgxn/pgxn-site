<p><a href="http://pgtap.org">pgTAP</a> is a unit testing framework for PostgreSQL written
in PL/pgSQL and PL/SQL. It includes a comprehensive collection of
<a href="http://testanything.org">TAP</a>-emitting assertion functions, as well as the
ability to integrate with other TAP-emitting test frameworks. It can also be
used in the xUnit testing style. For detailed documentation, see the
documentation in <code>doc/pgtap.md</code> or
<a href="http://pgtap.org/documentation.html" title="Complete pgTAP Documentation">online</a>.</p>

<p>To build it, just do this:</p>

<pre><code>make
make installcheck
make install
</code></pre>

<p>If you encounter an error such as:</p>

<pre><code>"Makefile", line 8: Need an operator
</code></pre>

<p>You need to use GNU make, which may well be installed on your system as
<code>gmake</code>:</p>

<pre><code>gmake
gmake install
gmake installcheck
</code></pre>

<p>If you encounter an error such as:</p>

<pre><code>make: pg_config: Command not found
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>Makefile:52: *** pgTAP requires PostgreSQL 8.0 or later. This is .  Stop.
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure that you have <code>pg_config</code> installed and in your path. If you used a
package management system such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, be sure that the
<code>-devel</code> package is also installed. If necessary tell the build process where
to find it:</p>

<pre><code>env PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make installcheck
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, if all that fails (and if you're on PostgreSQL 8.1 or lower, it
likely will), copy the entire distribution directory to the <code>contrib/</code>
subdirectory of the PostgreSQL source tree and try it there without
<code>pg_config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>env NO_PGXS=1 make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make installcheck
</code></pre>

<p>If you encounter an error such as:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR:  must be owner of database regression
</code></pre>

<p>You need to run the test suite using a super user, such as the default
"postgres" super user:</p>

<pre><code>make installcheck PGUSER=postgres
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to schema-qualify pgTAP (that is, install all of its functions
into their own schema), set the <code>$TAPSCHEMA</code> variable to the name of the
schema you'd like to be created, for example:</p>

<pre><code>make TAPSCHEMA=tap
make install
make installcheck
</code></pre>
